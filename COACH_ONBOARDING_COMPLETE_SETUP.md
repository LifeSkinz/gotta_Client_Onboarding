  - Rates & availability (pricing, session duration, timezone)

### âœ… **4. Admin Invitation System**

- **Professional email templates** for invitations

## ðŸš€ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Deploy Database Migrations**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd gotta_Client_Onboarding

# Deploy the new migration
supabase db push
```

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables**

Add these to your Supabase project secrets:

```bash
# Set your actual website URL (replace with your domain)
supabase secrets set WEBSITE_URL=https://your-actual-domain.com

# Set support email (optional)
supabase secrets set SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@your-domain.com
```

### **Step 3: Deploy Edge Functions**

```bash
# Deploy all updated functions
supabase functions deploy

# Deploy the new invitation function
supabase functions deploy send-coach-invitation
```

### **Step 4: Test the Flow**

1. **Send a coach invitation:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST 'https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-coach-invitation' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "email": "coach@example.com",
       "invitedBy": "your-user-id"
     }'
   ```

2. **Check the invitation email** - should contain onboarding link
3. **Click the onboarding link** - should open the multi-step form
4. **Complete the form** - should create coach account and profile
5. **Test coach session access** - should require authentication

## ðŸ“§ **New Email Flow**

### **Coach Invitation Email**
- **From**: Coaching Platform
- **Subject**: Join Our Coaching Platform - Invitation
- **Content**: Professional welcome with onboarding benefits
- **CTA**: "Complete Your Coach Profile" button
- **Link**: `{WEBSITE_URL}/coach-onboard?token={invitation_token}`

### **Coach Onboarding Process**
1. **Token validation** - checks if invitation is valid and not expired
2. **Multi-step form** - collects all necessary coach information
3. **Account creation** - creates Supabase auth account
4. **Profile creation** - saves coach data to database
5. **Role assignment** - assigns 'coach' role to user
6. **Confirmation** - shows success with coach ID

### **Coach Session Access**
1. **Authentication required** - redirects to login if not authenticated
2. **Coach verification** - ensures user is the assigned coach for the session
3. **Access granted** - shows session details and client information
4. **Secure data** - only shows data the coach is authorized to see

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Changes**
```sql
-- New tables created:
- user_roles (role management)
- coach_onboarding_invitations (invitation tracking)

-- New columns added:

-- New functions created:
- has_role() (role checking)
- validate_invitation_token() (invitation validation)
